# Kabin-AI-Smart-Home-Assistant
this college mini project is an example of a simple code for an AI assistant that involves using an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi and communicating with Python through a Serial API.

It's a great way to learn about cross-platform concepts. We hope you find it helpful!

NOTE: You can change the microcontroller to any of the Arduino board types but need to change the code a little bit and you no longer need the "frames.h" file anymore
